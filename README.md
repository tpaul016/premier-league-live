# premier-league-live
I am a big soccer fan and this web app gives me insight into the main topics being discussed on twitter during 
Premier League soccer games. Each Premier League game has a social media hashtag associated to it. To generate topics for a game, I 
retrieve tweets from Twitter's API using it's hashtag and feed it into the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model.
